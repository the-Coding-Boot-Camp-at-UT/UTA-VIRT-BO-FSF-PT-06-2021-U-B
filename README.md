## How to use me!

 * Clone me down!
   * Click the green code button
   * select the https link and copy it
   * Navigate to your git bash or terminal and run `git clone <and the link you copied!>` 
 * Now that I'm cloned you'll have all the code that was there when you cloned, but how do I get new code? Easy! Just run `git pull origin main` in your termail or git bash
   * Note: make sure you're in the folder locally when you run that command! 
 * As we proceed you'll need to have your code and the class repo code separate so once you pull the code down you'll have to move it to another folder to prevent conflicts!
